## Review
This is a simple implementation of the classic Python snake game using the Pygame library. 
My choice fell on the classic snake, because the mechanics of the game itself are not very complicated - the player controls a snake that tries to eat different fruits to grow, simultaneously avoiding collisions with walls or with himself. 
 

## Management 
- Arrow keys or WASD (up, down, left, right).
- Space to pause.
- Escape during the game to start a new game.
- Escape in the start window to exit the game.

## Installation 
1. Install Python
 - Download and install Python from the official website.
2. Install Pygame
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
 - Run the following command.
```
pip install pygame
 ```

## Starting the game 
1. Copy the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Start the game.


## How to play
1. Launch the game.
2. Use Enter to start the game.
3. Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the snake.
4. Eat fruits while avoiding colliding with walls or your own body.
5. Space bar to pause or escape to start a new game.
6. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or with itself.
8. Escape to exit the game. 

## Feedback
I will be glad to hear criticism and new ideas on how to improve the program.
